Project Name:

Java Basic Calculator



Objective:

The primary goal of the project is to create a simple and user-friendly console-based calculator application in Java that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts in Java, such as user input, conditional statements, loops, and modular code.


Features:

1. Basic Operations:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division (with error handling for division by zero)



2. User Input:

Interactive console-based interface for users to select operations and input numbers.



3. Error Handling:

Checks for invalid input, such as division by zero or invalid operation selection.



4. Clear Output:

Displays operation results in an easy-to-read format.



Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Java

Tools: Any IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans) or a text editor (e.g., VS Code) with the JDK installed.



Modules:

1. Main Program:
The main method initializes the calculator, displays the menu, and manages user input and operations.


2. Arithmetic Operations:
Encapsulates the core mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.


3. Error Handling:
Handles errors such as invalid input or division by zero.



Flow of Execution:

1. Start:

The program welcomes the user and displays a menu of available operations.



2. User Input:

The user selects an operation by entering a number (1-4).

The user inputs two numbers for the calculation.



3. Processing:

The program performs the selected operation and computes the result.



4. Output:

Displays the result or any error messages (e.g., invalid input).



5. Exit:

The program ends after displaying the result or when the user chooses to exit.


Benefits of the Project:

1. Educational:
Helps learners understand Java fundamentals like:

Handling user input via the Scanner class.

Conditional structures (if-else, switch-case).

Arithmetic operations.

Error handling and program flow.



2. Practical:
A working calculator can be extended with additional features, such as advanced mathematical operations or a GUI.



Future Enhancements:

1. Advanced Operations:
Add features like square root, exponentiation, modulus, and trigonometric functions.


2. Graphical User Interface (GUI):
Convert the program from a console-based application to a GUI-based calculator using Java Swing or JavaFX.


3. History Feature:
Store and display the history of calculations.


4. Continuous Operation:
Allow the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.
